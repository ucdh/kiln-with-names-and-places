            <h2>Roy Bruce's Letters</h2>
            <p>This is the home of the Roy Bruce Letters project, created by staff and students from the School of Humanities at the University of Cantebury. The aim of this project is to provide a research-quality digital edition of the correspondence of Major Roy Thomas Bruce during World War I.</p>
            <p>Roy Bruce was in the 8th Squadron of the Canterbury Mounted Rifles during the First World War. He fought in Gallipoli and was promoted to Second in Command in his regiment. He was twice wounded while serving in the Middle East. Most of the letters in this collection were sent to his wife, Maud Goodenough Bruce, and daughter, Helen Eugenie Bruce.</p>
